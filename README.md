# Nyankey
Nyankey is a free and open source microblogging server compatible with ActivityPub.

**It is not recommended to use Nyankey for your own instance, as it is tailored for [miruku.cafe](https://miruku.cafe)**.

Instead, you should use [Foundkey](https://akkoma.dev/FoundKeyGang/FoundKey) (fork of [Misskey](https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey), which Nyankey is based on)
